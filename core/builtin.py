builtins.py

Metadata about builtins.

TODO:
  - used for lookup in cmd_exec.py
    - need a hash of builtin names for quick testing?
  - handle completion of builtin NAMES -- pass to completion.py
    - handle aliases : . and source, [ and test
  - handle flags they take
    - handle completion of builtin FLAGS
  - handle args?  And check number of args?  e.g. 'break 3 4' -- "too many
    arguments" though.
  - handle help text
  - Add the "help" builtin itself

- builtins are NOT tokens I think

- Write our own option parser?
  - Expose it to the user of the proc dialect?

- NOTE: If it's going to be exposed to the user, it can't be done in with C++
  code generation!  This compiler perhaps needs to be ported over to the func
  dialect later!

- options: name, arity/type, help, var to set
  - long option name, I guess GNU style, as our usability extension for
    builtins, and also to allow users to use it
- also + vs -  -- set +o vs -o, pushd +3 -3
  - +o vs -o means that there are two values?  bool and string name?
  - might also need code generation for opts, since it is in "set" as well as
    the "sh" arguments itself.

NOTE: The POSIX spec defines only boolean flags essentially.  All builtins seem
to have at most 3 flags.  But bash has some with tons of flags, and it also has
args, e.g. for compgen.

- option groups?  For help only.  Although you can just write a code gen check
  to see if help lists all the options defined in the spec.
- default values
- GNU getopt has fuzzy matching... might want an option to turn that on or off.

Why does every shell have its own getopt?  I think you can just generate the
getopt string from Python optparse-like spec.

Well you don't want to depend on the GNU libc for long options, etc.  The
language should be self contained and not affected by libc (except possibly for
the old ERE regex syntax -- that can be regcomp?)

Not sure if help should be auto-generated.  We may be able to format it better
in a custom manner.  Although perhaps help should take an arg like help --xml
or help --json

Also --line-number etc. is annoying to type in both the spec and the help.

NOTE: bash has help -d -m -s.  Default is -s, like a man page.

parsing issues:
  combining stuff  cd -LP .

NOTE: Port metadata for ALL bash builtins, but don't implement all of them yet?
e.g. caller, command

Whether it's special or not!  This affects the search path and a couple other
things.  Didn't realize this.

"A syntax error in a special built-in utility may cause a shell executing that
utility to abort, while a syntax error in a regular built-in utility shall not
cause a shell executing that utility to abort. (See Consequences of Shell
Errors for the consequences of errors on interactive and non-interactive
shells.) If a special built-in utility encountering a syntax error does not
abort the shell, its exit value shall be non-zero.

"Variable assignments specified with special built-in utilities remain in
effect after the built-in completes; this shall not be the case with a regular
built-in or other utility.

http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/V3_chap02.html#tag_18_09_01_01

"If the command name does not contain any <slash> characters, the first
successful step in the following sequence shall occur:

"If the command name matches the name of a special built-in utility, that
special built-in utility shall be invoked.

"If the command name matches the name of a function known to this shell, the
function shall be invoked as described in Function Definition Command. If the
implementation has provided a standard utility in the form of a function, it
shall not be recognized at this point. It shall be invoked in conjunction with
the path search in step 1d.

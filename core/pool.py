### How to get a token value for execution
#
# It has a pointer to the middle of a std::string?  And a length?
# Reader owns the std::string buffers?
# Need to eliminate COMMENTS from memory so we don't have an execution penalty
# for using comments.

### How to get a snippet for an error traceback from a token
#  We need to display the file name and line_num
#
# self.AddErrorContext(token, "Message", args)
# - TODO: maybe add a word too
#
# 1. Take the token.
# 2. Look up line number in the Reader
#
# Reader() -- does it make sense to have one per file, or have a unified one?
# The reader can be
# - InteractiveLineReader
# - StringLineReader
#
# Maybe you need two classes:
#
# LinePool  -- per interpreter
# - the thing that owns the list of std::string
# - it will have a list of filenames too
# DebugInfo -- per interpreter
#
# And then Reader/Lexer/etc. are PER FILE
#
# class Token:
#   pool_index   # index into LinePool
#   col          # begin col
#   length       # end
# And then that contains the (filename, actual line number)
#
# class LinePool
#   Line lines[]
#   std::vector filenames;  // filenames in order that we read them.
#                           // NOTE: we need to normalize them.  Can we use
#                           // the inode num?.
#                           // do mksh/dash just parse the whole thing again?
#                           // there is no cache?
#   Clear()  -- If the parser detects a function, we have to move it?

# struct Line
#   std::string buf;
#   int file_num;  // index into filenames
#   int line_num;  // physical line number

## tuple: std::string, line_num
#
# ANOTHER OPTION: Just COPY the subset of the strings that you need.  Don't
# try to share.
# - This gets rid of a line of leading spaces and trailing comments
# - Might simplify code too
#
# Have a StringPool

# NAH -- This is over optimizing for size.

# HM: At first thought, you can do hashing of first words/ hashing of var
# names / copying and NUL termination of tokens (for execvpe() ) as parse
# time.
#
# But for some shell scripts this could be inefficient?  Hashes could come in
# a second memoizing step.  When a var is looked up, its hash value is cached
# forever.  (does this interfere with fork/COW)?

# In C++, InteractiveLineReader and StringLineReader should use the same
# representation: std::string with internal NULs to terminate lines, and then
# std::vector<char*> that points into to it.
# InteractiveLineReader only needs to save a line if it contains a function.
# The parser needs to set a flag if it contains a function!

# "In addition to the traditional globs (supported by all Bourne-family shells)
# that we've seen so far, Bash (and Korn Shell) offers extended globs, which

# *(pattern-list): Matches empty or any number of occurrences of the patterns
# +(pattern-list): Matches at least one occurrences of the patterns
# @(pattern-list): Matches exactly one of the patterns
# !(pattern-list): Matches anything EXCEPT any of the patterns
